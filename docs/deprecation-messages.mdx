## Summary

Deprecation messages are warnings that notify users that a specific feature, 
setting, or parameter will be removed and recommended to be replaced with 
something else.

A deprecation message clearly states: 

* what is being depricated,
* what action the user needs to take, 
* when the deprecated feature will be removed.

Example of a minimum viable deprecation message:

`Abc feature is deprecated. Use Xyz instead. Abc will be removed in n.n.`

Provide as much context as possible for what triggered the deprecation message. 
If action is not required (for example the default behavior is changing), 
describe the impact of doing nothing.

### Examples

* Setting `xpack.reporting.roles.enabled` is deprecated. Use feature controls to 
  grant reporting privileges. Reporting roles will be removed in 8.0.
* The Joda Time century-of-era formatter (C) is deprecated. Use a java.time 
  formatter instead. The century-of-era formatter will be removed in 8.0.
* The default for the `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark` setting is 
  changing from false to true. If you do not explicitly configure this setting 
  when you upgrade to 8.0, indices in this one node cluster will become 
  read-only if disk usage reaches 95%. 


## General guidelines

### What is deprecated

Use the present tense to describe what is deprecated: 

* Types are deprecated in geo_shape queries.
* Sorting is deprecated in reindex requests.

Avoid:

* The type should no longer be specified in geo_shape queries.
* Sorting has been deprecated in reindex requests.

### What action the user needs to take

Use the imperative voice:

* Do not specify a type in the indexed_shape section. 
* Use query filtering to reindex a subset of documents.

Avoid:

* Please use query filtering instead.
* You should use query filtering instead.
* Instead consider using query filtering to find the desired subset of data.

### Context

Where possible, provide the specific context that resulted in the message:

* The Abc timezone used by rollup job Def is deprecated. Use Xyz instead.

### Impact

Many deprecations are clearcut: you are using this old setting and need to 
switch to using this new setting. Others are more nuanced and don’t necessarily 
require any changes. In this case, the message needs to address the impact of 
not taking action:

* The default for the `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark` setting 
  changes from false to true. If you do not explicitly configure this setting 
  when you upgrade, indices in this one node cluster become read-only if disk 
  usage reaches 95%. 

### Version

If items are targeted for removal in a specific release, include that 
information in the message:

* Abc is deprecated. It will be removed in n.n.

If an item is deprecated but we don’t yet know in what release it will be 
removed, use:

* Abc is deprecated. Use Xyz instead. Support for Abc will be removed following 
  the release of n.0. 

Avoid:

* Abc is deprecated and will be unsupported in the future.
* Abc is deprecated and will not be supported in the next major version of 
  Elasticsearch.

### Formatting

Use sentence-style capitalization and punctuation. Highlight setting names by 
using quotation marks.

<DocCallOut >
  Ideally, monospace is used instead of quotes when the setting names are 
  displayed in the UI.
</DocCallOut >

## Elasticsearch examples

* Types are deprecated in `geo_shape` queries. Do not specify a type in the 
  `indexed_shape` section.
* Accessing the doc variable via `params.doc` from within a score-script is 
  deprecated. Access the doc variable directly.
* The default for the `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark` setting is 
  changing from false to true. If you do not explicitly configure this setting 
  when you upgrade, indices in this one node cluster will become read-only if 
  disk usage reaches 95%.


## Kibana deprecation messages

The Kibana deprecation service enables you to specify a title, message, 
documentation URL, and the manual steps for resolving a deprecation issue.

* **Title**:
  Example: Setting `xpack.reporting.roles.enabled` is deprecated
  No end punctuation is required.
* **Message**:
  Example: Use feature controls to grant reporting privileges. Reporting roles 
  will be removed in 8.0.
  Keep it brief, but multiple sentences are allowed if needed.
* **Documentation URL**:
  Don’t link to the Migration guide/breaking changes. Only specify a doc URL if 
  the user truly needs to “learn more” to understand what actions they need to 
  take.
* **Manual steps**:
  Example: 
     1. Set `xpack.reporting.roles.enabled` to false.
     2. Grant reporting privileges using feature controls in Management > 
     Security > Roles.
  State the action first for each step.

### Kibana examples

#### Example 1.

**Title**: Setting `xpack.reporting.roles.enabled` is deprecated

**Message**: Use feature controls to grant reporting privileges. The 
`xpack.reporting.roles` setting will default to false in 8.0 and will be removed 
in a future release.

**Manual steps**:
  
  1. Set `xpack.reporting.roles.enabled` to false. 
  2. Grant reporting privileges using feature controls in 
  Management > Security > Roles.

#### Example 2.

**Title**: Authentication configuration format is deprecated

**Message**: The `xpack.security.authProviders`, `xpack.security.public`, and 
`xpack.security.authc.{saml | oidc}.realm` settings are deprecated. Update your 
authentication provider configuration to use the new format. Learn more.

**Manual steps**:

1. Remove the `x`, `y`, `z` settings from kibana.yml.
2. Specify a prioritized list of authentication providers in the following 
  format:
  <snippet>

### Example 3.

**Title**: `map.proxyElasticMapsServiceInMaps` is deprecated

**Message**: Host the maps service locally instead of configuring a proxy. The 
`map.proxyElasticMapsServiceInMaps` setting will be removed in 8.0.

**Manual steps**:

1. Remove `map.proxyElasticMapsServiceInMaps` from the kibana.yml, CLI flag, or 
  environment variable (in Docker only).
2. Host Elastic Maps Service locally.
