Users need to understand how the user interface works without checking 
documentation in another page. Thus all of the messages, labels, and help text 
need to be as clear and concise as possible. Refer to the 
[EUI writing guidelines](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/guidelines/writing) to 
learn more about how to write for the UI.

In-product help or contextual help makes it possible to provide useful 
information for the user directly in the UI without the need of switching 
context or leave the user interface to consult the documentation. There are 
multiple options for providing additional contextual help, with slight 
variations depending on the specific Kibana app. You can find the available 
options, their descriptions, fields and tips of usage, and example codes below.

## Tooltips

A [tooltip](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/display/tooltip) is a brief message 
that provides additional information when a user hovers over a UI element.

* Use it to explain what a specific component is or does. For example, it might 
  explain what a table column shows or what a metric does.
* Keep the text to no more than 2 short sentences.
* Do not include links or text that requires special formatting.


1. [APM: TraceList.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/apm/public/components/app/trace_overview/TraceList.tsx)

## Icontips

An [icontip](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/display/tooltip) is a brief help 
text that provides additional information about a UI element only when a user 
hovers over an attached question mark icon.

* Use it to explain what a specific component is or does. For example, it might 
  explain what a table column shows or what a metric does.
* Keep the text to no more than 2 short sentences.
* Do not include links or text that requires special formatting.
* The icon color is grey, or black if it's used on a grey background.
* The icon is on the right side of the label.

1. [Machine Learning:explorer.js](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/ml/public/application/explorer/explorer.js)

## Popovers

A [popover](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/layout/popover) can provide 
longer explanations associated with a clickable element. Popovers are triggered 
on click.

* Use for “how it works” content, reference information, examples, or when you 
  need more space than provided in a tooltip.
* Consider this component instead of a learn more link, which takes the user off 
  the page.
* Add links or format text if it helps convey meaning.
* The icon color is blue.
* The icon is on the right side of the label.

<DocCallOut >
  Use popovers judiciously because they must be kept in sync with the 
  documentation.

## Flyout

Flyouts provide instructions for a complex task that might be hard to 
complete without help. It can also help users better understand a concept.

* Use a flyout instead of sending users outside the app to accomplish a task.

The benefit of this tool is that it opens from a link in the product, but does 
not take users outside the product. However, it is recommended to use this help 
sparingly, as it needs to be kept in sync with the documentation.

## Links to docs

### Learn more links

Learn more links typically appear inline after a description. They link to the 
documentation where users can get more detailed help. They carry low cost and 
high benefit, so they can be used wherever there is more to learn.

* Make sure that the Learn more links point to the right place.
* Check the relevant, linked content whether it needs to be updated or expanded.
* If the UI is helpful enough and the linked content that the Learn more link 
  points to doesn't add more value to the topic, do not create (or remove) the 
  Learn more link.

### Empty button links

Use an 
[empty button](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/navigation/button#empty-button) 
when you want to make a button look like a regular link, but still want to align 
it to the rest of the buttons on the page.

### Help menus

Many of the apps in Kibana have documentation links in the help menu.

1. [Machine Learning: help_menu.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/ml/public/application/components/help_menu/help_menu.tsx)

  ![The help menu in Machine Learning](images/mlHelpMenu.png)

This help menu is a bit unusual because it has a different URL depending on 
which page you're using in the app. 

2. [Canvas: application.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/canvas/public/application.tsx)

3. [Dashboards: help_menu_util.ts](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/src/plugins/dashboard/public/application/lib/help_menu_util.ts)

4. [Discover: help_menu_util.ts](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/src/plugins/discover/public/application/components/help_menu/help_menu_util.ts)

5. [Lens: help_menu_util.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/lens/public/help_menu_util.tsx)

6. [Maps: render_app.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/maps/public/render_app.tsx)

7. [Visualize: utils.ts](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/src/plugins/visualize/public/application/utils/utils.ts)
