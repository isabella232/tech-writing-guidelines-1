Users need to understand how the user interface works without checking 
documentation in another page. Thus all of the messages, labels, and help text 
need to be as clear and concise as possible. Refer to the 
[EUI writing guidelines](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/guidelines/writing) to 
learn more about how to write for the UI.

In-product help or contextual help makes it possible to provide useful 
information for the user directly in the UI without the need of switching 
context or leave the user interface to consult the documentation. There are 
multiple options for providing additional contextual help, with slight 
variations depending on the specific Kibana app. You can find the available 
options, their descriptions, fields and tips of usage, and example codes below.

## Tooltips and icontips

Use an [tooltip](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/display/tooltip) to add 
hover help to one or more words and a question mark icon. Use it to explain what 
a specific component is or does. For example, it might explain what a table 
column shows or what a metric does. Generally, it is useful for small snippets 
of information and not longer than one or two sentences.

1. [APM: TraceList.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/apm/public/components/app/trace_overview/TraceList.tsx)

2. [Machine Learning: timeseriesexplorer.js](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/ml/public/application/timeseriesexplorer/timeseriesexplorer.js)

If you want the help to appear only when you hover over the question mark icon, 
use an [icontip](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/display/tooltip). For example:

1. [Machine Learning:explorer.js](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/ml/public/application/explorer/explorer.js)

## Popovers

Use a [popover](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/layout/popover) to provide 
longer explanations associated with a clickable element. Popovers are ideal for 
“how it works” content, reference information, examples, or when you need more 
space than provided in a tooltip. Consider this component instead of a learn 
more link, which takes the user off the page.

One of the advantages of this tool is that you can add formatted text or a 
button to a popover and users don't lose focus from the page in contrast with a 
flyout.

  As popovers need to be kept in sync with the documentation, use 
  them judiciously.

2. [ML: help_popover.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/ml/public/application/components/help_popover/help_popover.tsx) & [anomaly_timeline_help_popover.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/ml/public/application/explorer/anomaly_timeline_help_popover.tsx)

## Flyout

Use flyouts to provide instructions for a complex task that might be hard to 
complete without help, especially if users have to go outside the app to 
accomplish the task. It can be also useful to help users better understand a 
concept, such as index patterns.

The benefit of this tool is that it opens from a link in the product, but does 
not take users outside the product. However, it is recommended to use this help 
sparingly, as it needs to be kept in sync with the documentation.

## Links to docs

### Learn more links

Learn more links typically appear inline after a description. Links to the 
documentation, where users can get more detailed help.

[Learn more link in calendars (ML app)](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/ccf961f8b751bbd715a4886bdc79c154c33067eb/x-pack/plugins/ml/public/application/jobs/new_job/pages/components/job_details_step/components/additional_section/components/calendars/description.tsx#L33)

  ![Learn more link in Calendars](images/mlCalendarLearnMore.png)  

### Empty button links

Use an 
[empty button](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/navigation/button#empty-button) 
when you want to make a button look like a regular link, but still want to align 
it to the rest of the buttons on the page.

[Cross cluster replication: follower_index_page_title.js](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/cross_cluster_replication/public/app/components/follower_index_page_title.js)

### Help menus

Many of the apps in Kibana have documentation links in the help menu.

1. [Machine Learning: help_menu.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/ml/public/application/components/help_menu/help_menu.tsx)

  ![The help menu in Machine Learning](images/mlHelpMenu.png)

This help menu is a bit unusual because it has a different URL depending on 
which page you're using in the app. 

2. [Canvas: application.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/canvas/public/application.tsx)

3. [Dashboards: help_menu_util.ts](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/src/plugins/dashboard/public/application/lib/help_menu_util.ts)

4. [Discover: help_menu_util.ts](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/src/plugins/discover/public/application/components/help_menu/help_menu_util.ts)

5. [Lens: help_menu_util.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/lens/public/help_menu_util.tsx)

6. [Maps: render_app.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/maps/public/render_app.tsx)

7. [Visualize: utils.ts](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/src/plugins/visualize/public/application/utils/utils.ts)
