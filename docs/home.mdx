Welcome, Documentarian!

This guide provides editorial guidelines for writing clear and consistent 
documentation and UI copy for Elastic products.

It has two main parts:

* <DocLink id="techDocs" />: if you are looking for information about the voice 
  and tone of the Elastic feature documentation, various content types, minimum 
  viable docs, or tips and tricks for drafting technical content.
* <DocLink id="uiCopy" />: if you are looking for information about terminology, 
  tools, and tips for writing in and about the user interface.
